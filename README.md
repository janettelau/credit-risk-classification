# credit-risk-classification

## Setup and Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to the cloned directory in Visual Studio Code.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `credit_risk_classification.ipynb`.
4. Run each cell sequentially to load the data, create and train the model, test it, and evaluate its performance.

## Credit Risk Analysis Report

### Overview of the Analysis
In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any other algorithms).

### Results
#### Machine Learning â€“ Logistic Regression Model
* Accuracy Score: 0.99
* Precision Scores:
    * Class `0` (healthy loan): 1.00
    * Class `1` (high-risk loan): 0.87
* Recall Scores:
    * Class `0` (health loan): 1.00
    * Class `1` (high-risk loan): 0.95

### Summary
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
